## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hotwire-debug'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hotwire-debug

## Usage

This gem adds assets into your applications vendor assets javascripts/stylesheets directories.

Update your `application.js`
```js
//= require hotwire-debug
```

Update your `application.css`
```css
/*
*= require hotwire-debug
*/
```

If your application does not already include stylesheets and javascripts in the layout, add them.

```erb
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', media: 'all' %>
```

# Options

By default the color-scheme is a Hotwire-inspired teal and yellow. There's an alternate color scheme available. Add `data-hotwire-scheme-dark` to the root element.

## Development
